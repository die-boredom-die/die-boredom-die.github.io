<p>Art - I&rsquo;m far from an aesthete, I couldn&rsquo;t tell you what colour puce is without having to look it up for the 100th time and  to be honest I didn&rsquo;t even know what &ldquo;aesthete&rdquo; meant until I looked that up. I also couldn&rsquo;t tell you why that picture of a lemon floating on a sea of magnets was a scathing indictment on the 1990&rsquo;s political climate in Manila - and to be entirely honest I can&rsquo;t even tell you if that’s a real work of art or something I just made up - it&rsquo;s been a long day.</p>

<p>But despite my failings as a connoisseur of the arts I can absolutely without a doubt tell you when I like a bit of art - and that, dear readers, is exactly what I&rsquo;m about to do right now&hellip;. brace yourselves.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/bodieh/">Bodie Hartley</a> is a fantasy illustrator that creates art prints to collectors cards to little choose your own adventure books. Not only is his <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bodieh/">Instagram</a>  a treasure trove of amazing art but he also sells this work via his online shop - <a href="http://slowquest.bigcartel.com/">Slowquest</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been collecting various bits and pieces he&rsquo;s been creating for the past year or two, but it&rsquo;s much better if I show you instead of telling you.</p>

<h2 id="choose-your-own-adve-ahem-pick-your-path">Choose Your Own Adve&hellip;, ahem, Pick Your Path</h2>

<p>The first thing that ever drew me into his work was the Pick Your Path zine that he had released.  It&rsquo;s a tiny little book but still a fully complete little adventure.  Sure, the adventure itself isn&rsquo;t exactly going to rock your world but that’s not the point.  The complete package is just a brilliant little bit of interactive art that you can hold in your hand, flick through pages and generally admire the awesome loveliness of it all.</p>

<p><img src="chooseyourownadventure3.jpg" alt="A Pick Your Path Adventure" /></p>

<h2 id="other-zines">Other Zines</h2>

<p>Other books/zines he has created are little informational books.  These can be used as a source of inspiration for dungeon masters wanting to build up a bit of lore around the world they create while role playing.  Or, you know, just look at because they&rsquo;re great - a little bit of quirkiness, a little bit of humour and lovely monochromatic art and writing.</p>

<p><img src="zines.jpg" alt="Zines" /></p>

<h2 id="collectors-cards-stickers-and-other-things">Collectors Cards, Stickers and Other Things</h2>

<p>Aside from the books and zines Bodie has created there have been a slew of other little bits and pieces along the way.</p>

<p><img src="cardsandstickers.jpg" alt="Cards and other things" /></p>

<p>The cards which feature things like traits, characters, weapons and spells were created so they could be used to do things like generating NPC in a D&amp;D session but as with the books just collecting these and leafing through is a lovely experience.</p>

<p>Over the holidays last year he even included a Beholder greetings card with every order - something that I think I was supposed to be given away to someone but there was no way in hell I was doing that.</p>

<p><img src="cardsandstickers2.jpg" alt="Cards and other things" /></p>

<h2 id="artwork-and-commissions">Artwork and Commissions</h2>

<p>Bodie has also dabbled in art that can be hung on a wall and admired.  There are a few stock pieces available and recently(ish) he has started toying with watercolours to add some colours to his work.</p>

<p><img src="wizardstower.jpeg" alt="Wizards tower" /></p>

<p>Early last year I mailed Bodie to see if he was available to do a commission piece as I wanted something particular I could put on my wall but unfortunately at that time he was working full time and didn&rsquo;t have the capacity to take commissioned work.  Fast forward to early this year and it turned out he was pursuing this art full time and now taking commissions.</p>

<p>Awwww yeah.  I wanted to get a small commissioned piece for each member of the family and boy did he deliver.</p>

<p><img src="commission.jpeg" alt="Commissioned pieces" /></p>

<p>These bad boys are going up, pride of place, in the games corner of our house.</p>
