      <description>At the start of the year D!B!D! dipped our hairy little toes in the world of Magic the Gathering. We bought Ollie 2 of the Planeswalker Decks because, let’s be honest here, we are 3 years into this whole tabletop gaming thing and we had yet to actually try any of the popular trading card games. Well actually that’s not 100% true Ollie and Nate did both go through a phase of collecting both Pokemon and Yu-Gi-Oh!</description>

      <description>Art - I&amp;rsquo;m far from an aesthete, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t tell you what colour puce is without having to look it up for the 100th time and to be honest I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know what &amp;ldquo;aesthete&amp;rdquo; meant until I looked that up. I also couldn&amp;rsquo;t tell you why that picture of a lemon floating on a sea of magnets was a scathing indictment on the 1990&amp;rsquo;s political climate in Manila - and to be entirely honest I can&amp;rsquo;t even tell you if that’s a real work of art or something I just made up - it&amp;rsquo;s been a long day.</description>

      <description>Survive: Escape from Atlantis is like playing Forbidden Island except you discover you&amp;rsquo;re playing Carcassonne but you&amp;rsquo;re playing it in reverse for some reason and someone decided to throw their copy of Get Bit into the mix.
Survive: Escape from Atlantis is nearly as old as me.
Survive: Escape from Atlanta is a not a Walking Dead themed version of this game but it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t surprise me if it eventually became one - you know what these crazy brands are like.</description>
