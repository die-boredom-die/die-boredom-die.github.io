      <description>Villagers, a euro card drafting game, has entered its final hours of its hugely successful Kickstarter campaign and so far is just over 5000% funded - yep that is not a typo five thousand percent. So it seems I&amp;rsquo;m not the only person excited for this one.
The goal in Villagers is to rebuild your village after the Black Death has taken the lives of many people. The player who has the most prosperous village by the end is the winner.</description>
