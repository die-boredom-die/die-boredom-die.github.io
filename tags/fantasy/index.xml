      <description>Art - I&amp;rsquo;m far from an aesthete, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t tell you what colour puce is without having to look it up for the 100th time and to be honest I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know what &amp;ldquo;aesthete&amp;rdquo; meant until I looked that up. I also couldn&amp;rsquo;t tell you why that picture of a lemon floating on a sea of magnets was a scathing indictment on the 1990&amp;rsquo;s political climate in Manila - and to be entirely honest I can&amp;rsquo;t even tell you if thatâ€™s a real work of art or something I just made up - it&amp;rsquo;s been a long day.</description>
